# Issue Lifecycle

To ensure a balance between work carried out by the NGINX engineering team while encouraging community involvement on
this project, we use the following issue lifecycle. (Note: The issue _creator_ refers to the community member that
created the issue. The issue _owner_ refers to the NGINX team member that is responsible for managing the issue
lifecycle.)

1. New issue created by community member.

2. Assign issue owner: All new issues are assigned an owner on the NGINX engineering team. This owner shepherds the
   issue through the subsequent stages in the issue lifecycle.

3. Determine issue type: This is done manually by the owner where necessary. The
   associated label is applied to the issue.

   Possible Issue Types:

   - `needs more info`: The owner should use the issue to request information from the creator.

   - `bug`: A problem causing a program to crash or produce invalid or unexcpected output.

   - `enhancement`: An enhancement, tackling technical debt or improving existing functionality or features.

   - `feature`: An addition of a new functionality or changing existing functionality​.
  
   - `documentation`: Documentation​ needs to be added or updated.

   - `question`: The owner converts the issue to a github discussion and engages the creator.

4. Determine milestone: The owner, in collaboration with the wider team (product management & engineering), determines
   what milestone to attach to an issue. Generally, milestones correspond to product releases.
